        I’m a full-stack software developer specializing in fintech and financial trading. I 
        create high-performance, secure, and scalable applications that drive financial 
        innovation. My expertise lies in thoroughly analyzing problems, planning solutions 
        meticulously, and executing them effectively.

      <p>
        With a background in Physics, I developed advanced mathematical models and explored 
        financial derivatives. The COVID-19 pandemic allowed me to deepen my interest in 
        trading and cryptocurrencies. I trained in algorithm design and worked on cutting-edge 
        missile systems before applying my skills at a cryptocurrency exchange, where I 
        gained insight into fintech solutions like embedded banking and Bitcoin for global 
        remittance.

      <p>
        Now, I’m focused on leveraging my experience to build innovative financial solutions.
